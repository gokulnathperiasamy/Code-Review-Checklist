# Requirement Review Checklist

> When examining a set of requirements (which may be in a Statement of Work), the reviewer might use the following questions to see that the document is adequate, perhaps while doing some type of review.

###### Documentation

1.	Have appropriate requirements documentation standards been followed?
2.	Are all figures, tables, and diagrams labeled and referenced?
3.	Are all terms and units of measure defined?
4.	Are all requirements written at a consistent and appropriate level of detail?
5.	Are individual requirements rated (or ranked), with descriptions of priority provided?
6.	Do the requirements provide an adequate basis for design and system test?

###### Completeness and Correctness

7.	Are all internal cross-references to other requirements correct? [For modifiability, minimize cross-references.]
8.	Are all classes of users described? Are the user characteristics described?
9.	Does the specification include all known customer or system needs? Are all the tasks the user wants to perform specified?
10.	Does each functional requirement specify input and output, as well as function, as appropriate?
11.	Have all dependencies on other systems been identified? (applications or application interfaces, databases, communications subsystems, networking, etc.)
12.	Are user documentation and training requirements addressed?
13.	Are the hardware and software environments specified? 
14.	Have all derived requirements been included? (those implied by the system or software requirements, generally constraints on development or verification)
15.	Has full life cycle support been addressed, including maintenance?
16.	Are any design or implementation constraints described?
17.	Are all reliability, recoverability (business continuity), and performance requirements properly specified?
18.	Are all security requirements properly specified?
19.	Are all safety requirements properly specified?
20.	Have all data privacy requirements been included?
21.	Are time critical functions identified, and timing criteria specified for them?
22.	Have any regulatory, legislative, or standards-driven requirements been addressed?
23.	Have all quality attributes (characteristics) been properly specified (i.e. efficiency, flexibility, interoperability, maintainability, portability, reusability, usability, availability)
24.	Have the human interface requirements been addressed? Are they correct?
25.	Are all external hardware, software, and communication interfaces defined? Are they correct?

###### Consistency and Clarity

26.	Does the specification agree with all relevant higher level documents?
27.	Are the requirements free of duplication and conflict with other requirements?
28.	Is each requirement written in consistent, clear, concise language?
29.	Does each requirement have only one interpretation? If a term could have multiple meanings, is it defined?
30.	Is each requirement verifiable by testing, demonstration, review, or analysis? 
31.	Are there measurable acceptance criteria for each functional and non-functional requirement?

###### Traceability

32.	Is each requirement uniquely and correctly identified?
33.	Is each requirement traceable to its source (including derived requirements)?

###### General 

34.	Are all requirements actually requirements, not design or implementation solutions?
35.	Are the time-critical functions identified, and timing criteria specified for them?
36.	Are all significant consumers of scarce resources (memory, network bandwidth, processor capacity, etc.) identified, and is their anticipated resource consumption specified?
37.	Have internationalization issues been adequately addressed?
